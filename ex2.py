#2. OOP with bank account.
#a) Write a bank Account class that has:
#
#    2 atributes: 
#        - name
#        - balance
#
#    and 2 methods:
#        - deposit (takes amount as argument, increase balance with amount)
#        - witdraw (takes amount as argument, decrease balance with amount if there is enough money on account)
#        
#    * implement magic method that allows to print Account instance in convenient way
#    
#    Example:
#    
#    client = Account('Bary', 100)
#    print(client)
#

#   
# b) write GoldenAccount class that inherits Account,
#    GoldenAccount can withdraw any amount of money without restrictions about balance.
